Hi! Thanks for stopping by.

I've long had an interest in discovering how things work: I was one of those kids who loved to take things apart, did FIRST robotics in high school, decided I wanted to understand the brain in college, and now I work on making better *in vitro* models of physiological systems to help understand human health and disease. 

Along the way I've been a lot of different things: general contractors assistant, farmhand, student journalist, adventure camp trip leader, trail crew, and photographer. I hope to add a few more before I'm too old. When I'm not in the lab, you can find me rock climbing, running, cycling, sailing, skiing, playing tennis, making music, woodworking, hiking, and making and eating pastries with my family in Vermont.
